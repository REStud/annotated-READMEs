# Style guide for markdowns

1. Use h1 headers for compulsory README section headings, like `# Data Availability Statements`.
2. Use h2 for subheadings.
3. Put file names in bacticks, like `master.do`.
4. Type lists and enumerations in markdown. Avoid including any HTML code unless absolutely necessary.
5. References are unordered lists.
6. Check for typos in URLs: these will stop Svelte from recognizing that they are URLs.
