# Replication Package for: Should Robots be Taxed? 
## Authors: Joao Guerreiro, Sergio Rebelo, Pedro Teles
<annotate>Your replication package can have fewer or more authors than the article. It is good practice to add research assistants who wrote the bulk of the code as authors.</annotate>
This replication package contains the Matlab code used to calibrate and solve the model described in the quantitative sections in Guerreiro, Rebelo and Teles (2021) “Should Robots be Taxed?” The replication package is split into four different folders: Data, Simple Static Model, Calibration, and Optimal Policy. Data includes all the data used in the calibration of the model. The folder Simple Static Model contains the code to solve the model in section 3. The folder Calibration contains the relevant codes to calibrate and solve the status-quo equilibrium described in sections 5.1 and 5.2. Finally, the folder Optimal Policy contains the codes that solve the optimal policy exercises in section 5.3.

The figures of the dynamic model are automatically copied to the folder Figures when running that code.
# Data Availability Statements
<annotate>Include a formal Data Availability Statement for each of the datasets you are using. The goal is to describe clearly the steps that readers have to take if they want to access the data.</annotate>

Fiscal Service, Federal Debt: Total Public Debt [GFDEBTN], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN, December 19, 2019.<annotate>Include the URL or DOI where data can be accessed and the date you have accessed it.</annotate>

3. The paper also uses data on private and public consumption to GDP ratios from the World Devel- opment Indicators, The World Bank obtained from https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators.
4. The paper also uses data obtained from NBER Taxsim which can be found in Feenberg, Daniel, and Elizabeth Coutts, “An Introduction to the Taxsim Model” Journal of Policy Analysis and Man- agement Vol 12, Number 1, Winter 1993, and the data are obtained from http://users.nber.org/~taxsim/allyup/ [Feenberg and Coutts, 1993].<annotate>If you are including data from another paper's replication package, cite the package as well as the paper.</annotate>	
5. The paper also uses data obtained from Guvenen, Fatih, Karahan, Fatih, Ozkan, Serdar, and Song, Jae, “What Do Data on Millions of U.S. Workers Reveal about Life-Cycle Earnings Risk?”, National Bureau of Economic Research (2015), retrieved from https://fguvenendotcom.files .word- press.com/2014/04/moments_for_website_final.xlsx [Guvenen et al., 2015].
6. Finally, the paper uses data obtained from IPUMS: Flood, Sarah, King, Miriam, Rodgers, Re- nae, Ruggles, Steven, and Warren, J. Robert, "Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, Current Population Survey: Version 6.0", Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS (2018). IPUMS-CPS does not currently provide the ability to store or reference custom extracts, but allows for redistribution for the purpose of replication. The archive contains the time series which are used in the analysis in the folder “Data/Occupations Data”.

# Computational Requirements
## Software Requirements
All codes use Matlab software. The code was run on Matlab Release 2020b. The optimization al- gorithms used are included in the Optimization Toolbox. Furthermore, we also use the HP filter algorithm from the Econometrics toolbox.
## Memory and Runtime Requirements 
The full set of code should take 1-2 days to run. The code was last run on a 2-core Intel-based laptop with 8 GB RAM.
