# Replication Package for: Should Robots be Taxed? 
## Authors: Joao Guerreiro, Sergio Rebelo, Pedro Teles
<annotate>Your replication package can have fewer or more authors than the article. It is good practice to add research assistants who wrote the bulk of the code as authors.</annotate>
This replication package contains the Matlab code used to calibrate and solve the model described in the quantitative sections in Guerreiro, Rebelo and Teles (2021) “Should Robots be Taxed?” The replication package is split into four different folders: Data, Simple Static Model, Calibration, and Optimal Policy. Data includes all the data used in the calibration of the model. The folder Simple Static Model contains the code to solve the model in section 3. The folder Calibration contains the relevant codes to calibrate and solve the status-quo equilibrium described in sections 5.1 and 5.2. Finally, the folder Optimal Policy contains the codes that solve the optimal policy exercises in section 5.3.

The figures of the dynamic model are automatically copied to the folder Figures when running that code.

IPUMS-CPS does not currently provide the ability to store or reference custom extracts, but allows for redistribution for the purpose of replication. The archive contains the time series which are used in the analysis in the folder “Data/Occupations Data”.

All data are publicly available.

# Computational Requirements
## Software Requirements
All codes use Matlab software. The code was run on Matlab Release 2020b. The optimization al- gorithms used are included in the Optimization Toolbox. Furthermore, we also use the HP filter algorithm from the Econometrics toolbox.
## Memory and Runtime Requirements 
The full set of code should take 1-2 days to run. The code was last run on a 2-core Intel-based laptop with 8 GB RAM.

# Description of Code
### Simple Static Model
This folder includes the programs to solve and draw the figures for the status-quo equilibrium in the static model. Running the file *Master.m* should run everything including obtaining the parameters of this model in the file *Parameters.m* and constructs the figure 1 with *DrawPlots.m*.
### Calibration
This folder includes the calibration and solution of the status-quo
equilibrium in our OLG economy. See the paper for details on the calibration
method. The codes should be run in the following order:
1. *Code1_Calibrate_SS1987.m* - calibrates and solves the initial
steady state equilibrium before automation. This program solves the
system of equations in *EqbmEq_SS1987.m*. This program calls
*Parameters.m* which includes all the externally calibrated parameter
values. (Short running time)
2. *Code2_SolveSQ_FinalSS.m* - this program solves the final steady
state. The equations are in *EqbmEq_FinalSS.m* (Short running
time)
3. *Code3_CalibrateTransition.m* - this program calibrates and
solves the transition from initial to final steady state. This uses
the file *SolveTransition.m* to evaluate the quality of fit of
the calibrated parameters, while the equilibrium equations for this
transition can be found in *EqbmEq_Transition.m*. (Long running
time - few hours)
4. *Code4_TransitionPost2017* - this program solves the equilibrium
after the 2017 Tax Reform. (Long running time - few hours)
5. *Code5_Figures.m* - this program constructs figures 2, 3, and
4 in the paper. (Short running time)

### Optimal Policy
### Summary table
The following table list the code used to produce each figure. We
list figures and  codes in the order in which they should be run.
